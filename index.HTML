                                <p>I visited bookmania last week and I was surprised because
                                     I think I would not get my book here but they have very 
                                     good and latest collection of Books.I found my book which 
                                     I needed and the price is affordable.They also have rare 
                                     collection of Indian and Western author's.The owner of the
                                      store is very humble. I also recommend you to go there and 
                                      explore new books.</p>
